This is the same as `test_basic`, but uses a conanfile.txt instead of conanfile.py.

This requires that the files WafDeps.py and WafToolchain.py by copied to a folder called `extensions/generators` in your conan folder. Example:

* ~/.conan2/extensions/generators/WafDeps.py
* ~/.conan2/extensions/generators/WafToolchain.py
